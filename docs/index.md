# Nifty Stock Research System

## Overview

The Nifty Stock Research System is an AI-powered platform for analyzing Indian stocks, specifically focusing on the NSE Top 100 companies. This project leverages Google's Gemini AI model to perform deep research and analysis of stocks, generating comprehensive reports and portfolio recommendations.

The system uses a unique approach called "vibe-coding" (stored in the [`prompts/`](https://github.com/as1605/nifty-llm-research/tree/main/prompts) directory) to generate human-like, contextually aware analysis of stocks. This methodology combines technical analysis with qualitative insights to provide a holistic view of each stock's potential.
