## Overall Basket Gain

Expected 1M Gain: 12.03%

## Analysis Summary

The portfolio is constructed to maximize short-term gains (1-month horizon) by identifying Indian equities with strong, near-term catalysts and robust underlying fundamentals, while ensuring broad diversification and prudent risk management. The selection prioritizes companies demonstrating recent positive financial performance (strong Q4 FY25 results), significant new order wins, strategic expansions, and those benefiting from favorable macroeconomic tailwinds such as India's robust GDP growth (projected 6.3-6.7% for FY25-26), easing inflation, and supportive RBI monetary policies (recent repo rate cuts). These factors are expected to boost corporate earnings, consumer spending, and infrastructure development, creating a conducive environment for stock appreciation.

**JINDALSAW** (14.99% expected gain) leads the portfolio, driven by its strong order book, strategic overseas expansion, and the positive impact of RBI rate cuts on the capital-intensive steel pipe sector. **RTNINDIA** (13.75%) offers exposure to high-growth new-age tech sectors like EVs and drones, supported by positive momentum and subsidiary developments. **JPPOWER** (13.1%) and **SWSOLAR** (12.9%) represent the energy sector, chosen for their significant profit turnarounds, debt reduction efforts, and strong order books in the booming power and renewable energy segments, respectively. **HINDCOPPER** (12.33%) benefits from ambitious capacity expansion plans and global green energy demand.

In the infrastructure space, **NBCC** (11.9%) is included for its strong order book and Q4 profit growth, while **GRSE** (11.0%) provides exposure to the defence and shipbuilding sectors, backed by robust Q4 results and government support. **INDIAMART** (9.99%) capitalizes on the accelerating digitization of Indian MSMEs, leveraging its dominant market share. **BLS** (9.44%) offers diversification into unique digital and visa services, characterized by an asset-light model and consistent growth. Finally, **PGEL** (9.11%) represents the consumer durables sector, driven by strong Q4 performance and optimistic future guidance.

Diversification is achieved by selecting stocks across various high-potential sectors including infrastructure, renewable energy, metals, diversified technology, digital services, and consumer durables. This multi-sector approach mitigates concentration risk, ensuring the portfolio is resilient to sector-specific downturns. Risk management is implicit in selecting companies with strong fundamentals, clear catalysts, and avoiding those with unmitigated short-term risks or highly speculative narratives, even if their projected gains were high. This balanced approach positions the basket for maximizing short-term gains while outperforming broader market indices.
