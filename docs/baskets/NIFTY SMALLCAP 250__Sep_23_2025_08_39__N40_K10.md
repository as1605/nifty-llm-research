## Analysis Summary

This portfolio of 10 stocks is constructed to capture short-to-medium term upside potential (7-30 days) while maintaining diversification across sectors and risk profiles. The selection prioritizes stocks with strong, clear catalysts and positive fundamental outlooks, while prudently accounting for identified risks.

**High Conviction (10-12% weight):**
*   **INOXWIND (12%):** Strong long-term growth potential in renewable energy, robust order book, strengthened financials from merger and rights issue. High gain potential (31.2% in 30 days) with manageable execution risks.
*   **WELSPUNLIV (11%):** Significant upside potential from resolution of US-India trade tensions (tariffs), strong Q2 FY25 performance, and capacity expansions. The trade deal is a major de-risking event.
*   **AFCONS (10%):** Robust project pipeline, substantial order book (including international wins), and strong Q1 FY26 net profit growth. Jefferies' 'Buy' rating with a high target reinforces confidence.
*   **JUBLPHARMA (10%):** Clean USFDA inspection is a major de-risking event, coupled with strategic focus on high-margin segments (Radiopharma, CDMO) and strong Q1 FY26 operational performance.
*   **WELCORP (10%):** Substantial and growing order book, strong Q1 FY26 financial performance, and strategic diversification (Sintex-BAPL) to reduce cyclicity. Positive analyst outlook and institutional interest.
*   **HINDCOPPER (10%):** Long-term growth driven by 20-year Rakha mining lease extension, MoU with Oil India, and aggressive capacity expansion plans. Favorable macro environment for copper demand.

**Moderate Conviction (9% weight):**
*   **IOB (9%):** Sustained financial turnaround, improved asset quality, government recapitalization plans, and FTSE All-World Index inclusion. Valuation is 'expensive' but positive catalysts are strong.
*   **USHAMART (9%):** Robust Q1 FY26 performance, net debt-free status, strategic capacity expansions, and 'One Usha Martin' transformation. Minor risks from near-term profitability dips.
*   **SCI (9%):** Strategic MoU with oil PSUs for long-term cargo contracts and government support for maritime sector. Privatization uncertainty is a key risk, but operational tailwinds are strong.
*   **RRKABEL (9%):** Strong fundamentals in the expanding Indian wires and cables market, ambitious capacity expansion plans, and strong FY24 performance. Risks from raw material volatility and FMEG segment profitability.

This portfolio aims for a balanced exposure to infrastructure, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and financial sectors, with a mix of established players and growth-oriented companies. Weights are adjusted to reflect the clarity and impact of catalysts versus the inherent risks mentioned in the summaries, favoring those with more immediate and less speculative drivers.
