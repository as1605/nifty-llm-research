## Overall Basket Gain

Expected 1M Gain: 5.11%

## Analysis Summary

This portfolio basket is strategically constructed to maximize short-term gains, specifically over the 1-week and 1-month horizons, while ensuring robust diversification to mitigate sector-specific risks. The selection prioritizes stocks with strong, identifiable catalysts and positive macroeconomic tailwinds within the Indian market.

**JIOFIN** (22% weight) leads the basket due to its highest projected 1-month gain (6.0%) and strong catalysts, including the expanded BlackRock partnership for stockbroking and wealth management, and its digital-first strategy. The accommodative RBI monetary policy further supports its growth in the financial services sector.

**ETERNAL** (20% weight) is included for its significant 1-month gain potential (5.02%) driven by its first-ever annual profit in FY25 and strategic diversification into high-growth digital consumer segments like quick commerce and event ticketing. India's robust economic growth provides a favorable backdrop.

**DRREDDY** (20% weight) offers exposure to the resilient pharmaceutical sector with a solid 1-month gain forecast (4.53%). Its upcoming Q1 FY26 results, strategic integrations, and biosimilar partnerships are key drivers, supported by a positive industry outlook and recent RBI rate cuts.

**ONGC** (19% weight) provides exposure to the energy sector, with a 1-month gain of 4.99%. Its substantial capital expenditure aimed at boosting future production and India's growing domestic oil and gas demand are strong fundamental supports, despite global crude price moderation.

**NTPC** (19% weight) rounds out the basket, representing the power generation sector with a 1-month gain of 4.93%. Its strong Q4 FY25 performance, ongoing capacity additions (including green initiatives), and pivotal role in India's energy transition make it a stable growth play.

This basket achieves diversification across critical sectors: Financial Services, Internet Services, Pharmaceuticals, Oil & Gas, and Power Generation. This mix reduces concentration risk and positions the portfolio to capture growth from various economic drivers, including consumer spending, infrastructure development, energy demand, and healthcare innovation, aiming to outperform broader market indices in the short term.
