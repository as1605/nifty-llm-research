## Analysis Summary

This portfolio of 10 stocks is constructed to capture short-term upside potential (7-14 days, with some extending to 30 days) based on diverse catalysts and a balanced risk-reward profile. We prioritized stocks with clear, recent positive news, strong financial performance, and favorable analyst sentiment, while also considering diversification across sectors to mitigate concentration risk.

**ALIVUS (12% weight):** Driven by a recent 'IND AA' credit rating upgrade and positive Q1 FY26 results, indicating fundamental re-rating and sustained investor interest. The target price is conservative, suggesting a good entry point.

**CENTRALBK (11% weight):** Strong upside potential from the government's privatization agenda (20% stake sale within six months) and robust Q1 FY26 performance, including improved asset quality. This is a high-conviction play on PSB sector turnaround.

**NBCC (10% weight):** Significant new order wins (over ₹1,700 crore from Goa, ₹3,700 crore from Rajasthan) provide strong revenue visibility. The stock is poised for upward movement as these contracts are executed.

**PTCIL (10% weight):** Catalyzed by the commissioning of a state-of-the-art VAR furnace for titanium castings (enhancing self-reliance in aerospace/defense) and robust Q4 FY25 results. This offers exposure to advanced manufacturing and defense.

**KARURVYSYA (9% weight):** Supported by a 'Buy' rating from ICICI Securities with a revised target price and strong Q1 FY26 net profit growth. The bank's asset recovery further strengthens its financial health.

**SIGNATURE (9% weight):** Record pre-sales in FY25 and strong Q1 FY26 results, coupled with ambitious FY26 guidance and positive analyst sentiment, position it well in the luxury housing segment.

**KAYNES (11% weight):** Bullish outlook due to its strategic position in India's semiconductor sector, successful first Made-in-India chip rollout, and significant investments/JVs in OSAT facilities. This is a high-growth technology play.

**AAVAS (9% weight):** Driven by a 'Positive' outlook from CARE Ratings, consistent AUM growth, and strategic expansion in affordable housing. Despite some 'overvalued' concerns, strong fundamentals support continued appreciation.

**MGL (9% weight):** Despite recent price correction due to gas price reduction, strong bullish sentiment from analyst reports (Motilal Oswal, ICICI Securities) focusing on long-term benefits of lower input costs and demand growth. This is a contrarian pick with strong analyst backing.

**DEEPAKFERT (10% weight):** 'Positive' outlook from CRISIL Ratings due to strategic capacity expansion in TAN and Nitric Acid, combined with a recent technical breakout on high volumes. This offers exposure to a growing specialty chemicals sector.

This portfolio balances exposure across banking (CENTRALBK, KARURVYSYA, AAVAS), infrastructure/manufacturing (NBCC, PTCIL, DEEPAKFERT, KAYNES), real estate (SIGNATURE), and consumer services (MGL, ALIVUS). Each stock has specific, recent catalysts supporting its short-term growth, while the diversification aims to mitigate individual stock-specific risks.
