  "reason_summary": "This portfolio of 10 stocks is constructed to capture short-to-medium term upside potential (7-30 days) while maintaining diversification across sectors and risk profiles. The selection prioritizes stocks with strong, clear catalysts and positive fundamental outlooks, while prudently accounting for identified risks.\n\n**High Conviction (10-12% weight):**\n*   **INOXWIND (12%):** Strong long-term growth potential in renewable energy, robust order book, strengthened financials from merger and rights issue. High gain potential (31.2% in 30 days) with manageable execution risks.\n*   **WELSPUNLIV (11%):** Significant upside potential from resolution of US-India trade tensions (tariffs), strong Q2 FY25 performance, and capacity expansions. The trade deal is a major de-risking event.\n*   **AFCONS (10%):** Robust project pipeline, substantial order book (including international wins), and strong Q1 FY26 net profit growth. Jefferies' 'Buy' rating with a high target reinforces confidence.\n*   **JUBLPHARMA (10%):** Clean USFDA inspection is a major de-risking event, coupled with strategic focus on high-margin segments (Radiopharma, CDMO) and strong Q1 FY26 operational performance.\n*   **WELCORP (10%):** Substantial and growing order book, strong Q1 FY26 financial performance, and strategic diversification (Sintex-BAPL) to reduce cyclicity. Positive analyst outlook and institutional interest.\n*   **HINDCOPPER (10%):** Long-term growth driven by 20-year Rakha mining lease extension, MoU with Oil India, and aggressive capacity expansion plans. Favorable macro environment for copper demand.\n\n**Moderate Conviction (9% weight):**\n*   **IOB (9%):** Sustained financial turnaround, improved asset quality, government recapitalization plans, and FTSE All-World Index inclusion. Valuation is 'expensive' but positive catalysts are strong.\n*   **USHAMART (9%):** Robust Q1 FY26 performance, net debt-free status, strategic capacity expansions, and 'One Usha Martin' transformation. Minor risks from near-term profitability dips.\n*   **SCI (9%):** Strategic MoU with oil PSUs for long-term cargo contracts and government support for maritime sector. Privatization uncertainty is a key risk, but operational tailwinds are strong.\n*   **RRKABEL (9%):** Strong fundamentals in the expanding Indian wires and cables market, ambitious capacity expansion plans, and strong FY24 performance. Risks from raw material volatility and FMEG segment profitability.\n\nThis portfolio aims for a balanced exposure to infrastructure, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and financial sectors, with a mix of established players and growth-oriented companies. Weights are adjusted to reflect the clarity and impact of catalysts versus the inherent risks mentioned in the summaries, favoring those with more immediate and less speculative drivers.",
